The ticket lifecycle in osTicket begins with Ticket Intake, where a user submits an issue through the user portal or email (if configured). Once submitted, the system assigns a unique ticket ID and sends a confirmation notification to the user. This stage ensures that all necessary information about the issue is collected. To streamline this process, you can customize the ticket submission form to include mandatory fields like the user's name, email, and a detailed description of the issue. Properly structured ticket intake helps minimize back-and-forth communication, saving time for both the user and the support team.

The second stage, Assignment and Communication, involves reviewing the ticket and assigning it to the appropriate department or agent based on predefined help topics or issue categories. The assigned agent takes responsibility for the ticket, initiating communication with the user to acknowledge receipt and gather any additional details if required. Automation tools in osTicket can significantly enhance this process by triggering assignment rules and sending predefined email templates for initial responses. This stage is crucial for setting the tone of user interaction and ensuring that the ticket is actively being worked on.

In the Working and Resolution phases, the assigned agent investigates and resolves the issue while keeping the user updated through the user portal or email. Agents can collaborate with team members using internal notes, and SLA plans can help track resolution timelines to maintain service quality. Once resolved, the agent documents the solution in the ticket and updates the status to "Resolved." The user is notified of the resolution and has the option to confirm the closure or reopen the ticket if further assistance is needed. Collecting user feedback via surveys at the end of the process ensures continuous improvement in service delivery. These stages collectively ensure that issues are addressed efficiently while maintaining clear communication with the user.
